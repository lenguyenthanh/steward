# Steward

Runs the [scala-steward-action](https://github.com/scala-steward-org/scala-steward-action) daily to update the dependencies of my projects.  Pull requests are opened by the [nt9-bot](https://github.com/apps/nt9-bot).

## Adding a repo

This action will only work on my projects.  For your projects, see [diy-steward](https://github.com/armanbilge/diy-steward/).

## Restart workflows after 60 days

Go to [actions/workflows](https://github.com/lenguyenthanh/steward/actions/workflows/steward.yml) click `enable workflows`
